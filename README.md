# Public_API_Data_Fetching_Scripts

This Repository contains 3 scripts that fetch some specific data from the Cat API
and the Weather API.

To fetch data from a public API using Python, you typically need the requests library. 
It is not included by default in Python's standard library, so you must install it first.

To install requests, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install requests
